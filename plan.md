# Implementation Notes

First: Implement Agents with different trading strategies: 
        - look up stock trading strategies 

<<<<<<< Updated upstream
Create an Orderbook which matches buy and sell offers of all bots
=======

We have to think about the dataframes for the following:

- Agent portofolio, centralized. This keeps track of the amount of money and 
which agent owns which stock -> done

- Order book, centralized. This keeps track of all transactions of each stock
maybe its best to have one order book that keeps track of all transactions of all stock -> done

- Now: Implement trade option for multiple stocks, and ability to make multiple Trade offers, for a different quantity of stocks, also trade condition has to be changed to ask if there is enoughg money. Put diversification as a goal!
