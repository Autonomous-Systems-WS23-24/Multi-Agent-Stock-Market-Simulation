# Multi-Agent-Stock-Market-Simulation

The aim is to design and implement a multi-agent stock market simulation. The simulation will model a dynamic stock
market environment with various types of autonomous agents, exploring the complexities of financial markets with
different buying/selling strategies and auction clearance rules.

#Objectives

Create a multi-agent system for simulating a stock market environment.
Implement different agent types with distinct trading strategies.
Explore the usage of historical data to feed the simulation.
Features
1. Agent Types: Develop distinct agent types, such as investors and brokers, each with unique trading strategies.
2. Market Environment: Create a virtual stock-market environment with synthetic or historical stock price data where
the agents act.
3. Agent Behaviors: Define agent decision-making behaviors, including trading strategies (e.g., using financial
indicators) and learning mechanisms.
4. Portfolio Management: Investors can have varied investing strategies (long-term vs. short-term, portfolio
diversification, etc.).
5. Risk attitudes: Investors can have different risk attitudes, from risk-taking to risk aversion.
6. Realistic Simulation Implement realistic market dynamics, including price fluctuations through historical data and
order matching.
7. Data Visualization: Create visualizations representing stock prices, trading volumes, agent interactions, and their
performance.
